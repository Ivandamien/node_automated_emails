# **Sending Automated emails using Nodemailer and NodeJS**

### In this project , I have implemented email atomation using express and npm module `nodemailer`. I used `Mailtrap.io` which is a service for the safe testing of emails sent from the development and staging environments. Mailtrap catches your emails in a virtual inbox so that you can test and optimize your email campaigns before sending them to real users.
